Welcome to FutureBB.

This app is based on the FutureBB Framework.

NGINX USERS:
If you use nginx, URL rewriting is still a little buggy. Please make sure you know how the configuration works before you install this. If you don't know nginx configuration, either find somebody who does to help you or put /dispatcher.php at the end of the base URL and base path in the installer.

Setup instructions:
1. If you plan on using MySQL and do not already have a database available, create one. If you are using SQLite, please make sure the necessary libraries are installed (please note that this software currently only supports SQLite 3, no earlier versions).
2. Go to http://yourforum.com/path/to/forum/install.php
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.
